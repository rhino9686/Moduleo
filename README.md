# Moduleo

### Introduction
In short, Moduleo is a robot. One that can do a handful of tasks, enabled by its modular design. It's based on a powertrain system with a dual motor driving scheme and a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery. The powertrain platform is be self-contained, with ports to mount different modules upon for flexible configurations. The first module being designed for it is a system of sensors to detect air quality and report it to a mobile app on a user’s device. Other modules may be designed, and need only implement a standard interface of communication to connect to the powertrain platform. The design is ongoing and will be subject to change as different components and technologies are weighed.


### Motivations
The motivations for designing and architecting this project stem from various factors. Firstly, my final embedded systems course, EECS 473, had a pesky requirement that all projects be “useful” and “marketable” rather than simply being fun to make. This project is more an exploration of the technologies in modern embedded systems, that incorporates all I learned in school as well as the analog hardware design I've learned during my tenure as an engineer -- in a fun package.

Secondly, it's my first solo project, building on my software and hardware knowledge while also serving as an exercise in design, manufacturing, and packaging with a bit of CAD and hands on crafting.
